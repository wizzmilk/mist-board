This Ethernet USB dongle is verified to be compatible with the latest Atari ST core for the MIST. The implementation is compatible with the Ethernec and the original STing drivers can be used. Getting online with an Atari was never easier.

**Your task: Create a cool video making it obvious to anyone why the MIST is such a great thing to own**

## ~~MIDI Add-on board~~ ##

![http://mist-board.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/bounty_midi.jpg](http://mist-board.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/bounty_midi.jpg)

The MidiAddon adds Atari ST compatible MIDI ports to your MIST. There's a reason why the ST was famous for its MIDI capabilities. It can be mounted inside the original MIST case. Be warned: Basic soldering and some skills in metal work required!

**~~Your task: Implement MIDI for the Minimig/Amiga core. This can be done as proven by this nice person from RetroRamblings: http://retroramblings.net/?p=412*~~~~

## ~~One of my fully functional hand soldered prototype boards~~ ##

This is one of the first boards i ever made. While it looks different from the series board its 100% compatible. It took me 4 hours to assemble one. It's a once-in-lifetime to get one as i'll sure never build more of them.

~~**Your task: Give the MIST/Minimig core AGA support. And let my finally run Pinball Fantasies, the only game i ever played on an Amiga 20 years ago :-)**~~
