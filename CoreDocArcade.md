# Overview #

This page documents how to setup the arcade cores.
They are all quite similar, just vary slightly in supported features.


# Installation #

The arcade cores are self-contained in their own `*`.rbf file, so it is enough to copy them to the root of an SD card.

Arcade cores are not recommended as the default startup core, as they do not have an OSD menu to switch to a different core. When running one of these cores you can reset the MiST with the left front panel button to return to the startup core, allowing to choose another one.
