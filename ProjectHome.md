# One Chip to Rule them All #

Get your own MIST board [here](http://lotharek.pl/product.php?pid=96)!

The MIST board was designed to implement classic 16 bit computers like the Amiga and Atari ST(E) as System-on-a-Chip using modern hardware. But it equally well supports 8 bit systems like the Atari XL, ZX81, ZX Spectrum, C64, Atari VCS, Atari 5200, Colecovision, Apple II, Sega Master System, NES, Odyssey2 and more ...

The MIST board is not about emulation. It's about the [re-implementation of the original hardware itself in so-called FPGAs](WhatIsThis.md).
